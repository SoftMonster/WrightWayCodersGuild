        <h1>Sid Meier's Civilization VII: Major Changes</h1>
        <p>Sid Meier's Civilization VII introduces several significant changes and enhancements compared to Civilization VI, offering a fresh and dynamic gameplay experience.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Division into Distinct Ages</h2>

        <p>In a departure from previous installments, players in Civilization VII select a new civilization at the start of each Age. This mechanic allows for a layered historical experience, where your empire evolves through different civilizations over time, each with its own abilities, units, and buildings.</p>
